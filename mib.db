"	Indicates whether the SNMP agent process is\
	permitted to generate authentication-failure\
	traps.  The value of this object overrides any\
	configuration information; as such, it provides a\
	means whereby all authentication-failure traps may\
	be disabled.\
	\
	Note that it is strongly recommended that this\
	object be stored in non-volatile memory so that it\
	remains constant between re-initializations of the\
	network management system."
