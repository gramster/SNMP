# Open Mind Solutions SNMP Library

Back in 1995 myself and a couple of friends started Open Mind Solutions, which later became Citadel Data Security and eventually CEQURUX,
with a product line of firewalls and VPN routers. But when we first started, we were planning on going in to the SNMP space, to try to
compete with HP OpenView. It turned out our potential customers were more interested in Internet security, so we pivoted.

This is theSNMP client  code I wrote before that pivot happened.
